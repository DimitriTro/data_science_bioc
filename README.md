# Prediction on Bioceanor time series

To run the code first create a python 3 environment and install packages using the requirements.txt in the root directory.
Then run main.py to get all pre-processing, training, pr√©diction and validation done.
In the directory ./plots you'll find the training and test loss and, for each device, the train/test + validation prediction versus real signal on the target variable.

The overall approach is resumed and explained in ./rapport.docx file.

In directory ./exploration you'll find one notebook for doing data exploration.
